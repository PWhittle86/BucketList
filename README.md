## Bucket List

In your groups, create an application to make a ['bucket list'](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bucket%20list) of countries you want to visit.

### This is not a paired programming exercise. It's a chance to use Git and work seperately on different features of your app before group projects next week.

- Use the rest countries API to get the countries of the world.
- Add countries to a bucket list.
- Persist this list using Mongo.
- Try to split your client code into models and views. Think about the responsibilities of each.

Possible extensions:

- Add a Leaflet Map with markers for countries on the bucket list
- Add more detail to the bucket list items - e.g. landmarks you want to visit or the season you want to visit in. Persist these to Mongo too.
- Style the app

Show and tell is at 3pm Thursday, where every group will be asked to talk about their experience.
